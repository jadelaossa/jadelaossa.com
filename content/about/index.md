I'm an electronic engineer who studied at the University of Seville and have been working in the aerospace industry for close to 10 years now. My experience in the field has revolved around analyzing data, using my skills to identify patterns, trends, and potential areas for improvement. I take pride in my work, as I know how important it is for the aerospace industry to operate with the highest level of accuracy, efficiency, and safety. That's why I've always made it a priority to stay up to date with the latest technologies, techniques, and methodologies that are relevant to my profession.

Currently, I'm based in Cologne, Germany, where I work remotely as a data scientist for a prominent aerospace company. This has allowed me to broaden my horizons, work with colleagues from different countries, and contribute to projects that have a global impact. While my role is challenging and requires a lot of focus and attention to detail, I find it deeply fulfilling to be able to use my expertise to solve complex problems and help the aerospace industry evolve.

In addition to my work, I'm also pursuing a postgraduate course in data science and machine learning at the University of Barcelona. This is a natural progression for me, as I've always been passionate about learning and expanding my knowledge base. The course is rigorous and demanding, but I'm excited about the opportunity to dive deeper into the field of data science and explore its many applications. I believe that this additional qualification will not only enhance my skills as a data scientist but also give me a competitive edge in the industry. Overall, I'm proud of my achievements so far and eager to see where my career takes me next.
